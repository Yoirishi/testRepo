# Doxyfile 1.1.4-20000625

# This file describes the settings to be used by doxygen for a project
#
# All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored
# The format is:
#       TAG = value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ")

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# General configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded
# by quotes) that should identify the project.

PROJECT_NAME          = CMAKE

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number.
# This could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or
# if some version control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER        = 0.0.1

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute)
# base path where the generated documentation will be put.
# If a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the location
# where doxygen was started. If left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY      = ./Doxygen

# The OUTPUT_LANGUAGE tag is used to specify the language in which all
# documentation generated by doxygen is written. Doxygen will use this
# information to generate all constant output in the proper language.
# The default language is English, other supported languages are:
# Dutch, French, Italian, Czech, Swedish, German, Finnish, Japanese,
# Spanish and Russian

OUTPUT_LANGUAGE       = English

# The DISABLE_INDEX tag can be used to turn on/off the condensed index at
# top of each HTML page. The value NO (the default) enables the index and
# the value YES disables it.

DISABLE_INDEX         = NO

# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available.
# Private class members and static file members will be hidden unless
# the EXTRACT_PRIVATE and EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES

# If the GENERATE_HTML tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will
# generate HTML output.

GENERATE_HTML         = YES

# The HTML_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the HTML docs will be put.
# If a relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be
# put in front of it. If left blank `html' will be used as the default path.

HTML_OUTPUT           = html
